      description:
         "The notion that matter was comprised of Atoms began as philosophical statements in the 5th century BC by the ancient Greeks, who coined the term atomos, meaning “uncuttable.” But, that great society was simply not known for its coffee, and hence disappeared. If you need a coffee that you cannot cut with your spoon, this is your coffee. This blend combines various compounds of coffees that when dissolved in water as a regular or espresso coffee accents a rich smooth taste. But be careful, atoms are known to move quickly, as fast as 1100 mph. So don’t get hurt by drinking this potion that is truly the building blocks of matter.",

         "Our lightest blend is a combination of Indonesian and South American coffees. The first Neanderthals appeared 350,000 years ago. Our blend is much fresher. Neanderthals had many adaptations for a cold climate – our blend is wonderful served hot or over ice, and adapts well to any coffee cup. They were known for large braincases, robust builds, and large noses — our blend is known for its robust body, and aroma that satisfies any nose. This is no timid coffee – it is naturally sweet with a creamy texture. We cannot prove or disprove any impact on the human brain.",

         "This blend combines the best of coffee from the Americas and Indonesia. More than 3,000 years ago the wooly mammoth adapted to survive the cold environment of the ice age. These early mammals had long hair, small ears, and layers of fat to keep them warm. This blend will warm you up without causing you to grow any extra hair, shrink your ears or add any fat — in fact, served black it will have no calories whatsoever. So if you feel like you are just waking up after a 3,000 year slumber and want something that is welcoming, but not excessively loud, this is your coffee.",
